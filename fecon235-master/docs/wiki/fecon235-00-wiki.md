##  Wiki for fecon235

GitHub renders wiki pages for **fecon235** at https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235/wiki
which is available shortened as https://git.io/econ

The contents of the wiki is actually developed in a *separate* repository
called `fecon235.wiki`, so for convenient reference we shall periodically 
reproduce it under `docs/wiki/mirror` (but not as a subrepository).

The wiki is intended as user documentation, and may include FAQs, tips,
as well as summaries of issues and best remedies.

Please kindly consider contributing to our documentation via 
[pull request](https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
